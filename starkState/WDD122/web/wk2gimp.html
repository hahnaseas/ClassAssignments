<h1>Wk2 Gimp Collage</h1>
<h2>How It's Done:</h2>
    
<p>I first started this collage with gathering my pictures, and was feeling a Fall collage. I first laid all my pictures where I wanted them to be, so that's it easier to see what I'm working with. I then did some layer masks. I admit that it was tricky how to navigate around gimp, especially with the scissor-select. I played around with some of the other tools such as the free-select, scale, rotate, bucket, paintbrush, and eraser tools. I used scale-image to convert my images to the correct resolution while sizing and moving/rotating them as needed.
    
With the scissor-select, I tried to make the pumpkins (in the barrel) pop out more. Additionally, I did the same with the coffee cup and candle in the bottom-right picture. Both of which I tried to enhance their colors with a layer mask. The technique I did to the apple was that I tried to section it out (with some layer masking) with the scissor-select and free-select tool. I was trying to go for an ombre with the different sections on the apple. </p>
