<h1>Wk2 Gimp Drawing</h1>
<h2>How It's Done:</h2>
    
<p>
I first started by utilizing the tools provided by Gimp and use the gradient tool to fill in the background with a blue-purple gradient. I then proceeded to path tool to create the stars, tend, and fire. The stars and fire were polygonal paths, while the fire is a curved path. I admit it was quite tricky to work with the curve paths. Additionally, I decided to add the tent, wood/rocks, bush, and mountain to add to the campfire theme that I was going for. 
    
Additionally, I used different modes to help add to the drawing such as 
addition and soft light, while adjusting the opacity for some layers. For the firepit, I decided to add some details around the fire such as changing the brush settings to add and take away overlapping pieces. I sized down on my brush to add some details to the logs while I also lowered the hardness on the erase brush to get rid of the logs that overlapped the rocks. Lastly, I added some light around the pit to add some color to the drawing. I brushed some orange around the rocks to add warmth and some depth to the drawing to make it pop out more.
