<h1>Wk11 Inkscape Poster</h1>
<h2>How It's Done:</h2>
<p>I first started by adding the text to the poster, and set it to Goudy Stout to help with the overall look. Next, I start with adding the lego pieces, all ranging from size, colors, and studs (the nub on top of a brick). I did this with the rectangle tool and circle tool, and then grouped the pieces together. This is how I created my custom background as well, but wanted to add more pieces to make it all stick together. Additionally, for the dot in the i's, I thought I'd make it a lego piece instead. Moreover, I did two paths- one with the pen tool that I traced lego hands and moved it to make it look like they were holding the bricks. The difference path I used a rectangle and circle to create a shape and put it on the side of the ttile textbox.</p>
