<h1>Wk13 Typography</h1>
<h2>How It's Done:</h2>

<p>
After finding the image, I deciding on doing a futuristic/AI theme and have the the text to surround the image. At first, browsing through Inkscape's fonts is very limited (such as editing programs), so I downloaded a free font [Robot-font] from DaFont and installed it into Inkscape. I then had time to type out what I wanted to and experiemtn with the spacing and placement. I initially wanted to do some vertical with some horizontal, but settled on horizontal for easier reading. After placing the text, I decided that it needed something to make it "pop", so I added a white rectangle above the image (bg) layer and set the filter to 'color' to make it black/white with some color. Additionally, I changed the font colors alternating from grays to whites to help it stand out more.
