<h1>Wk13 Inkscape Final Project</h1>
<h3>How It's Done: Logo</h3>
<p>
My inspiration for the logo came instantly for me. Ever since I was little, I was always fascinated by watches and would always play with my dad's. Ever since, I grew a fondness in watches and started a collection of my own. My first ever watch was a Fossil watch, which is why I decided to make a logo for Fossil Watches. Initially, I wanted to try to incorporate the watch face onto the watch band with the text, but it was too much of a hassle. I first started with the text and had the idea to make the 'o' the face. There I created the hands, dials, markers, and everything else that represented a watch. I wanted to add more detail to it, but it would've collided with the text, so I decided to keep it simple. Moreover, I wanted to add a watch strap somewhere and added it underneath the text as if it were to underline it. The watch face and strap were all created with mostly the circle and rectangle tool, with some shaping here and there. I didn't want to overcomplicate it too much.

<h3>How It's Done: Vector Drawing</h3>
<p>
This one was also a no-brainer. I wanted to attempt to create a vector drawing from an image and the first thing that came to my mind was Taylor Swift! I'll keep it short, but ever since I started listening to her, she's been a big inspiration for me! I must admit, tracing isn't the easiest, so I did struggle a bit. But, I was up for a challenge! For this vector drawing, I started out with the outline and worked my way from the outside. I think the most tricky part apart from the hair, was trying to trace the clothes without them looking weird or too big. If I thought a path wasn't filled in, I'd either erase it or fill in the gaps. I then discovered the node tool and helped cut down my time of filling in the cracks! Addiitonally, I added a background so that the drawing didn't look flat. The text and shapes I added last to help define what I was trying to convey in my vector drawing.

<h4>So, What's The Catch?</h4>
<p>Initially, I wasn't thinking of a theme when I was creating these two. But the more I thought about it, I could create a Taylor Swift watch inspired by my favorite album "Folklore". She's certainly not going out of style with her watch collection! Swift's favorite watch is her Everose Gold 36MM Rolex, surprise! Who would've thought?</p>
